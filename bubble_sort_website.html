                <p class="text1">GeeksforGeeks is a good platform to learn programming.
                    It is an educational website that helps prepare for recruitment drives
                    of product-based companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, etc.
                    with a free online placement preparation course. The course focuses
                    on various MCQs & coding questions likely to be asked in
                    interviews to make your upcoming placement season efficient and
                    successful. Also, any geeks can help other geeks by writing articles
                    on GeeksforGeeks. Publishing articles follows a few steps: articles
                    that need little modification/improvement from reviewers are published first.
                    To quickly get your articles reviewed, please refer to existing articles,
                    their formatting style, and coding style, and try to make your articles
                    close to them. In case you are a beginner, you may refer to the
                    guidelines to write an article.</p>

                <h3 class="heading4">Bubble Sort</h3>
                <p>Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that 
                    works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if 
                    they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for 
                    large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.</p>
                <h3 class="heading4">Advantages of Bubble Sort Algorithm</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a simple algorithm, easy to understand and implement.</li>
                    <li>It is beginner-friendly and can be good for explanatory purposes.</li>
                    <li>The space complexity for the bubble sort algorithm is constant, O(1). 
                        No additional data or memory is required; it is an in-place sorting algorithm.</li>
                    <li>It can be adapted easily.</li>
                    <li>It is a stable algorithm, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements found in the array.</li>
